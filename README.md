# Bayes-Label-Bias

#.  Developing a Bayesian Approach to address the issue of label bias. This study focuses on developing a generalizable Bayesian framework for modeling uncertain, subjective, or noisy labels across diverse research domains. While prior work in Bayesian latent-class models, measurement error, weak supervision, and noisy-label learning has addressed domain-specific challenges, this project aims to create a unified approach that can be applied to any label-based study, providing robust inferential insights.

# Major components of the study

1. Generalizable Framework
Existing work is often domain-specific (e.g., diagnostic tests, mental health, NLP). The novel contribution here is a flexible framework applicable to any research context with uncertain or misclassified labels.
2. Covariate-Dependent Misclassification
Traditional latent-class or Dawidâ€“Skene models assume constant sensitivity/specificity. This research models sensitivity and specificity as functions of covariates, capturing systematic biases such as demographics or rater characteristics.
3. Unified Bayesian Treatment
Unlike weak supervision or ML approaches that separate label modeling from prediction, this framework jointly models latent labels and covariate effects in a hierarchical Bayesian manner, allowing full propagation of label uncertainty into parameter estimates.
4. Sensitivity Analysis and Identifiability
While measurement-error literature focuses on specific applications, this project provides a general, reproducible methodology for exploring identifiability and prior sensitivity across domains.
5. Bridging Statistical and ML Communities
This framework bridges the gap between ML approaches focused on prediction and statistical approaches focused on inference. It can handle large, complex datasets (e.g., EHR, omics) while maintaining rigorous inferential validity.
